# Descriptive_Statistics_Analysis
Day 20 – Descriptive Statistics &amp; Data Distribution Analysis (Python)

📊 Descriptive Statistics Analysis
Day 20 – Data Analysis Internship
🔎 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing descriptive statistical analysis to understand data distribution, variability, and spread of features within the dataset.

The goal is to summarize numerical variables using statistical measures and interpret patterns through visualization.

🎯 Objectives

Compute measures of central tendency

Calculate measures of dispersion (Variance, Standard Deviation, Range)

Analyze quartiles and interquartile range (IQR)

Detect skewness

Identify potential outliers

Interpret statistical findings

🔄 Methodology
1️⃣ Data Loading & Inspection

Loaded dataset using Pandas

Checked dataset dimensions and structure

Verified missing values

2️⃣ Central Tendency Measures

📈 Key Insights

Some features show higher variability.

Distribution patterns indicate skewness in specific variables.

Standard deviation highlights spread of data.

Outliers were identified using IQR method.
